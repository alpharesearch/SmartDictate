# For specific project structures, you might use:

ConsoleApp1/obj/

# NuGet packages folder
# Typically not needed if using modern SDK-style projects, as packages are global.
# However, if you have a local 'packages' folder for some reason:
# packages/
# *.nupkg
# *.snupkg

# User-specific files
*.DotSettings.user

# Other common ignores
*.log
*.tmp
*.temp
local.settings.json
appsettings.Development.json # Often contains secrets or local overrides

# Large binary files (like your models)
# It's better to download these separately or use Git LFS if they *must* be in the repo.
# For now, explicitly ignore them by name or pattern if they are in your source tree
# but shouldn't be committed.
